# [Notebook](https://shawndjw.github.io/notebook)

This is my personal notebook designed to provide a structured space for
recording thoughts, ideas, observations, and information in the form of
an [online mkdocs book](https://www.mkdocs.org/) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/shawndjw/notebook).

**The wiki is meant to be read [in the web
format](https://shawndjw.github.io/notebook).**
