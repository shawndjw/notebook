# Steak Marinade

I love a steak and rarely need to add anything but salt & pepper or Montreal Steak spice but sometimes you buy a cheaper cut of meat or settle for AA vs AAA. I found the below recipe and it was a hit with my better half so it's a keeper!

## Incredients
* 2 steaks
* 4 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp ketchup
* 1 tsp minced garlic
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp pepper

## Directions
1. Blend all ingrediets, pour over steaks.
2. Marinate 1 to 3 hours, longer is better, turning frequently
3. Grill to your preference
